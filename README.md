# Bulgarian Data Leaks — Threat Intelligence Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a publicly available, open-source threat intelligence and awareness dashboard that tracks publicly reported data leaks affecting Bulgarian citizens, organisations and institutions.

The goal is NOT to distribute, trade, store, or expose personally identifiable information (PII), but to:

- Raise awareness of real cyber threats in Bulgaria
- Visualise trends and sectors most affected by breaches
- Provide material for education, research, and CTI training
- Support students and professionals in cybersecurity, OSINT, and incident response fields

This platform is for **educational, research, and defensive cybersecurity purposes only**.
